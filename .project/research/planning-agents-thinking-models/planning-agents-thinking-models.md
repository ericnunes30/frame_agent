# Planning Agents with Thinking Models

## 1. Definition of Models of Thinking vs Models of Chat

### Thinking Models (Reasoning Models)
Thinking models, also known as reasoning models or Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), are advanced AI systems designed to perform complex cognitive tasks that require deep analytical processing, logical deduction, and multi-step reasoning. These models are specifically optimized for:

- **Deep Processing**: They engage in extensive internal reasoning before producing responses, often using techniques like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) or Tree-of-Thought (ToT) to break down complex problems.
- **Strategic Problem-Solving**: They excel at tasks requiring planning, hypothesis testing, and systematic exploration of solution spaces.
- **Explicit Reasoning Traces**: They generate explicit reasoning steps that show their thought process, making their decision-making more transparent and interpretable.
- **Complex Task Execution**: They are particularly effective in domains like mathematics, scientific reasoning, coding, and strategic planning.

Examples include models like DeepSeek Reasoner, Qwen QWQ, GPT o3 Mini, and Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking.

### Chat Models
Chat models, or general-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs), are designed primarily for conversational interaction and immediate response generation. Their characteristics include:

- **Fast Response**: They prioritize quick, contextually appropriate responses over deep analytical processing.
- **Conversational Fluency**: They excel at natural language understanding and generation for dialogue, content creation, and information retrieval.
- **Broad Applicability**: They are versatile across many tasks but may not specialize in complex reasoning scenarios.
- **Direct Processing**: They typically generate responses directly without extensive intermediate reasoning steps, though they can be prompted to "think."

Examples include Llama 3.3, GPT 4o Mini, Gemini 2.0 Flash, and Deepseek Chat.

### Key Differences
Research has shown that reasoning models outperform chat models in accuracy on complex tasks (71% vs 68% in one clinical document classification study), but chat models demonstrate greater stability (91% vs 84% consistency). This suggests a trade-off between accuracy and consistency, with reasoning models excelling in complex scenarios but potentially being less reliable in straightforward tasks.

## 2. Characteristics of Planning Agents with Thinking Models

Planning agents that incorporate thinking models possess several distinctive characteristics:

### Dual-Process Architecture
Many advanced planning agents implement a dual-process framework inspired by human cognition:
- **Fast Thinking (System 1)**: Handles routine decisions and immediate responses
- **Slow Thinking (System 2)**: Engages in deliberate, analytical reasoning for complex problems

Examples include:
- **SwiftSage**: Combines a fast "Swift" module for intuitive responses with a deliberate "Sage" module for complex reasoning
- **DUMA**: Uses two generative LLMs dedicated to fast and slow thinking respectively
- **Talker-Reasoner Architecture**: Separates conversational responses (Talker) from multi-step reasoning and planning (Reasoner)

### Hierarchical Reasoning and Planning
These agents often decompose complex tasks into manageable sub-tasks:
- **Multi-Level Processing**: They can switch between high-level strategic thinking and detailed execution planning
- **Recursive Task Decomposition**: Complex problems are broken down into smaller, solvable components
- **Dynamic Integration**: Different types of tasks (retrieval, reasoning, composition) are integrated flexibly

### Reflective and Adaptive Capabilities
Advanced planning agents with thinking models incorporate meta-cognitive abilities:
- **Self-Reflection**: They can evaluate their own reasoning processes and outcomes
- **Adaptive Planning**: They adjust their strategies based on feedback and changing conditions
- **Error Correction**: They can identify and correct mistakes in their reasoning

### World Modeling and Simulation
These agents often maintain internal models of their environment:
- **Predictive Modeling**: They can simulate potential outcomes of different actions
- **Contextual Understanding**: They maintain awareness of environmental states and how their actions affect them
- **Long-term Planning**: They can consider consequences of actions over extended time horizons

## 3. How These Agents Differ from ReAct Agents

### ReAct Agents
ReAct (Reasoning + Acting) agents combine reasoning and acting in an interleaved manner:
- **Alternating Process**: They alternate between generating reasoning traces and executing actions
- **Environment Interaction**: They directly interact with external environments (tools, APIs) based on their reasoning
- **Immediate Feedback**: They receive immediate feedback from the environment to inform subsequent reasoning steps
- **Single-Step Reasoning**: Each reasoning step is typically focused on the immediate next action

### Planning Agents with Thinking Models
Planning agents with thinking models differ in several key ways:

#### Depth of Reasoning
- **ReAct**: Performs reasoning in service of immediate actions, with reasoning typically focused on short-term goals
- **Thinking Models**: Engage in deep, multi-step reasoning that may involve abstract planning, hypothesis generation, and exploration of multiple solution paths before any action is taken

#### Planning Horizon
- **ReAct**: Generally operates with a short-term planning horizon focused on immediate task completion
- **Thinking Models**: Can engage in long-term strategic planning, considering multiple future states and potential contingencies

#### Cognitive Architecture
- **ReAct**: Follows a linear Reason-Act cycle with direct coupling between reasoning and action
- **Thinking Models**: Often implement more sophisticated cognitive architectures with separate modules for different types of processing (fast vs. slow thinking, planning vs. execution)

#### Independence of Reasoning
- **ReAct**: Reasoning is tightly coupled with environmental actions and feedback
- **Thinking Models**: Can perform extensive reasoning internally without environmental interaction, similar to human "thinking"

#### Meta-Cognitive Abilities
- **ReAct**: Limited self-reflection capabilities, primarily focused on task completion
- **Thinking Models**: Enhanced meta-cognitive abilities including self-evaluation, strategy selection, and adaptive reasoning approaches
